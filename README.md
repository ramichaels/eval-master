# Developer evaluation

Please fork this repo. Make the unit tests pass. And send me a pull request.

## Sequnce tests

Run each test one at a time. Make the first test pass before moving on to the second one. You can send separate pull requests for each test.

### CanGetOddNumbers

Given an enumerable of integers, return an enumerable containing only the odd numbers. The test here is not so much can you tell an even number from an odd (although you should be able to). It's to see how you process sequences. There are several alternatives. Choose one and make the test pass.

There's a problem with the test. Can you spot it? If so, go ahead and fix the test.

### CanExamineInfiniteSet

Given the entire collection of integers, does your implementation still work? If not, switch to a new technique.

## Good luck

This evaluation should take no more than 30 minutes.
